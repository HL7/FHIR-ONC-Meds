## US-Meds Conformance Requirements -Discuss if needed during ballot

This section outlines conformance requirements for the client and the server identifying the specific profiles that need to be supported, the specific RESTful operations that need to be supported, and the search parameters that need to be supported. Note: The individual US-Core profiles identify the structural constraints, terminology bindings and invariants, however, implementers must refer to the conformance requirements for details on the RESTful operations, specific profiles and the search parameters applicable to the client and server.
